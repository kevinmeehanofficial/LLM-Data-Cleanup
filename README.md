# Data Cleaning Scripts for LLM Training

## Overview

This repository contains a set of scripts designed to facilitate the data-cleaning process for training Large Language Models (LLMs). Clean and high-quality data is crucial for the successful training of language models, and these scripts aim to streamline the data preparation steps.

Note: I am using these scripts to prepare data for training Financial Service LLM Models, but they could be applied for any use case. Also, I am keeping this repository fluid and efficient, so scripts are each designed for a specific task and can be hacked away and combined however you want. View the scripts each as a foundational tool. 

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with using the data cleaning scripts:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/kevinmeehanofficial/llm-data-cleaning.git

2. **Install Dependencies (each subdirectory contains a unique requirements.txt):**
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Hack away at the simple and efficient clean-up scripts and run them using Python:**
**On Linux, Run the Script Using**
python3 Script_Name.py

**On Windows***
python Script_Name.py
