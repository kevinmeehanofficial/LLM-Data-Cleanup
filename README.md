## Data Cleaning Scripts for LLM Training

### Overview

This repository contains a set of scripts designed to facilitate the data-cleaning process for training Large Language Models (LLMs). Clean and high-quality data is crucial for the successful training of language models, and these scripts aim to streamline the data preparation steps.

Note: I am using these scripts to prepare data for training Financial Service LLM Models, but they could be applied for any use case. Also, I am keeping this repository fluid and efficient, so scripts are each designed for a specific task and can be hacked away and combined however you want. View the scripts each as a foundational tool. 

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the Repository
To begin, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash

```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Each subdirectory in this repository has a unique `requirements.txt` file. Install the necessary dependencies with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run the Scripts
The scripts are designed to be straightforward and efficient. Execute them using Python:

- **On Linux:**
